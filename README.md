A weather dashboard with detailed real-time weather specs pulled from the Open Weather API


This project was surprisingly fun. I felt that the topics from previous exercises really helped put this together. APIs were confusing at first, but have become a bit more understandable after some continued practice. 

I did some additional styling and color changing to make the page look a little more exciting, and was able to execute the majority of the technical requirements with the exception of the 5-day forecast.
